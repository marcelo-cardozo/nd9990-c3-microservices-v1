## Lesson 5 - Service Registration, Discoveryâ€Š & Scaling
The exercises in this lesson are an extension of the exercises you have already done in the previous **"Lesson 4 - Kubernetes"**. We will use the same "Udagram" project from the previous lesson. 

### Start 
Clone the following Git repository - https://github.com/udacity/nd9990-c3-microservices-v1 and stay on the `master` branch. Navigate to the */lesson-5-Service-Registration/exercises* directory.

### Dependencies
There are no additional dependencies required for this lesson, other than the ones already installed in [lesson 4](https://github.com/udacity/nd9990-c3-microservices-v1/blob/master/lesson-4-Kubernetes/README.md).

### Exercises
To get the application running we need to extend the Kubernetes manifest with Configmaps, Secrets, and Services. Please execute the following tasks:
1. Create configmaps and secrets for your application
2. Create Kubernetes service for the deployments
3. Expose the application locally (check kubectl port-forward)
4. Scale your application

Bonus: Expose your Kubernetes service with an external load balancer
