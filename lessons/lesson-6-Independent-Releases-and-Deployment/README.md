## Lesson 6 - Independent Releases and Deployments
The exercises in this lesson are an extension of the exercises you have already done in the previous - **"Lesson 5 - Service Registration, Discoveryâ€Š & Scaling"**.  We will use the same "Udagram" project, to integrate a CI system.



### Start 
Clone the following Git repository - https://github.com/udacity/nd9990-c3-microservices-v1 and stay on the `master` branch. Navigate to the *lesson-6-Independent-Releases-and-Deployment/exercise* directory.


### Dependencies
In addition to the dependencies already installed in [lesson 4](https://github.com/udacity/nd9990-c3-microservices-v1/blob/master/lesson-4-Kubernetes/README.md), this lesson requires the following to be installed:

* Travis CI - [Refer this tutorial to get started with Travis CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/tutorial/)


### Exercises
Integrate a CI system and use the CI system to build our images. For this, we will use Travis CI. Please execute the following task:
* Connect TravisCI with your Github repository
* Add a `.travis.yml` to your repository
* Build the container with Travis
